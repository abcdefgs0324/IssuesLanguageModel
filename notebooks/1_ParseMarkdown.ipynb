I am connecting to the fileserver using sshfs and osxfuse, Instead of seeing the 65 TB, I see only 10GB of free space. Finder uses the wrong amount to calculate if I can move files to the fileserver or not. The problem is not the Mac or finder because using scp I can transfer the files. Cheers Alexander  \n",
